# Introduction
AI has been a very popular topic when it comes to education, especially ChatGPT. I have heard of students using AI to help them with their assignments and even with random tasks. In my experience, I had been in a group where we used ChatGPT to create our team name. AI can be a very useful tool when it comes to software engineering, especially when having Copilot. I have heard that Copilot was very useful when we went over JavaScript. In this class, I have not used any AI technologies, however, I wish I had to gain experience using these tools that can help me in the future.

# Personal Experience

## Experience WODs
For the experience WODs, I did not use any AI technologies while completing them. Personally, I found that by first attempting the WOD and then watching the demonstration worked best for me. I was able to identify which parts I needed to improve upon, and then attempted the WOD again. Because this routine has worked well for me, I did not use AI. 

## In-class Practice WODs
Similar to the experience WODs, I found it most helpful for me to attempt the in-class practice WODs on my own. If I were to get stuck, I would look over my experience WODs to see if I could use the code to accomplish the task, or if I could modify it to fit what I needed. However, if I still had trouble, I would ask my partners for help. Having my classmates and my work had helped me complete the practice WODs without having to use AI.

## In-class WODs
During the WODs, I did not use AI to complete them. My goal was to try to finish the WODs on my own; I tried to only use my previous work and the documentations to help me. I also did not know how to use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, so sticking with my notes worked best for me. I think in the beginning, it may have been helpful to have used ChatGPT or Copilot when we were going over JavaScript. However, I think it may have been a bit more difficult when having to create the mockup pages from the given image. I feel that if I were more comfortable using AI, it would have been a great additional tool for the WODs.

## Essays
I have not used AI to aid in creating my essays. I think that the essays in this class were more personal, where I added my personal experience and thoughts into them. Due to this, it could have been a bit more difficult to be personal in my writing if I were to use AI. However, I do think that I could have used AI to help me improve upon my essays by possibly asking for ideas on what to write about given the prompt. Doing this could have helped improve upon the quality of the content of the essays.

## Final Project
As of right now, I have not used AI when working on the final project. My team and I had mainly worked on the UI for our pages, and now focusing on the functionality of the website. I do think that I will try to utilize AI to gain more experience with it. For example, if I were to stumble upon a problem in my code, I want to try to use ChatGPT to help me fix my code. It would be a great opportunity for me to play around with AI technologies before the class is over. 

## Learning a Concept / Tutorial
I did not use AI to learn a concept or to see a tutorial. I think that the video demonstrations and the code documentations did a great job with going over the concepts. However, if I needed clarification on a topic, I would conduct a Google search instead of using AI. I think that AI would be a great tool if after conducting research on the concept and still not understanding it, I could try to use ChatGPT to see if their explanation can help me.

## Answering a Question in Class or in Discord
I did not use AI to assist me with answering questions in class or in Discord. Like I stated above, the videos on the class website and the code documentation were very informative, so if one of my peers were to ask a question, I would rely on these sources to help find an answer. It may have been more time-efficient if I were to use ChatGPT, however I think that going this route has allowed me to better retain the concepts by helping others. 

## Asking or Answering a Smart Question
In this class, I do not think I posted questions in the smart_questions channel. This is due to me not knowing how to phrase my questions into a smart question. I think that I could have used AI to help me either answer the question I had, or to help me format my question to meet the guidelines of what a smart question needs.

## Coding Example
I did not use AI to provide me with coding examples. If I needed an example, I would refer back to my experience WODs to look over my code or the code documentations. Though, if I needed additional examples, I would use Google. AI would have been a great tool, especially if I wanted a specific example. 

## Explaining Code
When it comes to explaining code, I did not use AI. I did my best to try to use my own words to try to explain my code to others, but it was a very difficult task. I could have used AI to see how they would explain it, then try to summarize their explanation in a way that I and the person I am talking to could both understand it.

## Writing Code
I did not use AI to write code. I wanted to challenge myself to try to code on my own because I feel that my coding foundation is not too strong. If I struggled, I used my code from the experience WODs, in-class practice WODs, and the documentations to guide me when writing code.

## Documenting Code
I feel that I did not document code often in the class. I understand that it is great practice to do so, but I do not remember doing so. I would only have code documentation if it was already provided, and I just made modifications to fit my code.

## Quality Assurance
I did not use AI to help me with quality assurance of my code. I would use the errors given from ESLint or from the terminal to help me see where in my code the error was present. I would then try to see how I can fix it using the suggestions from ESLint. If that did not work, I would conduct a Google search to see if someone else had the same problem as me. I think that going the AI route could have been more time-efficient.

# Impact on Learning and Understanding
Personally, I did not use AI in this class. My coding skills are not the best, so I wanted to challenge myself to try to do my work without AI. I feel that by forcing myself to do the work without any assistance, I was able to develop a stronger foundation in understanding how to code, especially when it came to JavaScript. I think JavaScript was one of the most difficult parts of this class, but I feel that my struggling has allowed me to learn. I do think that AI can have a positive impact on understanding software engineering concepts. In some cases, working backwards from the solution can provide a lot of information on why the code works, and can use this knowledge to apply to the work in this class. I also think that AI can be a very useful tool in trying to understand a concept because it can provide a variety of explanations that can best help me.

# Practical Applications
I think a great practical application of AI used in the real-world is voice assistance on our devices. I am an avid user of Siri on my phone because of how convenient it is to use when I cannot use my hands to operate my phone. It is a very cool and interesting tool to play around with. I think that voice assistance helps us further our knowledge in machine learning and in tur help with software engineering challenges in the real-world. We could utilize the concepts of AI and machine learning to think of solutions that can be applied to software engineering.

# Challenges and Opportunities
As I mentioned above, I did not personally use AI in this course. The biggest challenge of mine with AI is not knowing how to use it. ChatGPT and Copilot were always mentioned that we could use to help us with our code, but because I did not know how to use them and did not make time to learn how to use the tools, I did not use it. I think to further integrate AI in software engineering, it could be helpful to set aside time in the course to teach students how to use the AI tools. By including it in the curriculum, this can educate students who are not familiar with AI technologies. This may motivate them to use it in class.

# Comparative Analysis
In software engineering, instructors teach students the concepts, provide them with practice assignments, then test their knowledge through assessments or projects. With my personal experience in traditional teaching methods, students are tested on their coding knowledge with little to no use of outside resources. However, in AI-enhanced approaches, I think that outside resources are highly encouraged, especially using AI technologies. When it comes to knowledge retention, I think both methods have their pros and cons. In traditional teaching, a pro would be that by not having resources available during the assessments, students must learn and understand the concepts to be able to utilize it in the exams. However, a con is that a student may cram all the information just for the exam and forget it the next day, which shows that they did not retain the concepts. A pro with AI-integrated teaching is that students have available sources to them that if they were to get stuck, they may use these tools to help them get a solution. However a con with this style of teaching is that students can fully rely on AI to code instead of producing their own work, which may indicate that they do not have a strong foundation in the concepts. All in all, both styles of teaching has their advantages and disadvantages.

# Future Considerations
I think that AI will be more commonly used in software engineering education in the future. An advancement to education would be that AI can provide students with a coding solution if they were to get stuck on a problem. For some people, working backwards from the solution is very helpful in understanding the code. By seeing a working solution, the student can see where in the code they made mistakes and learn why the solution works. I think that a big challenge would be if students were to fully rely on AI to code, then there is a possibility that they might not retain the coding concepts. In this case, the student may struggle with coding without having any assistance. To tackle this, I think that the software engineering education could focus on ensuring that as AI further improves and be more useful in coding that students are retaining and understanding the concepts that they can apply themselves.

# Conclusion
All in all, I think that AI can be a very useful tool when it comes to software engineering. Looking back, I regret not exploring ChatGPT and Copilot to help with different parts of this course. However, with the remaining time I have left in this class, I will do my best to utilize these tools. As for the different styles of teaching software engineering, I believe that both traditional and AI-generated teaching can be both beneficial and disadvantageous, depending on the student. Both teaching styles do their job of teaching students the concepts and providing them different mediums to practice. However, I believe that it is up to the student to put in the effort to understand and retain coding knowledge. In that sense, I do think that integrating AI into the software engineering curriculum is a very promising idea.
