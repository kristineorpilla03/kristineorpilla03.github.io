## Introduction

AI has been a very popular topic when it comes to education, especially with ChatGPT. Over time, AI grew to become a very useful tool for many students. In software engineering, AI can be used in a variety of ways: 

## Personal Experience

### Experience WODs
For the experience WODs, I did not use any AI technologies while completing them. Personally, I found that by attempting the WOD and then watching the demonstration worked best for me. I was able to identify which parts I needed to improve upon, and then attempted the WOD again. Because this routine has worked well for me, I did not use AI to help me.

### In-class Practice WODs

# Impact on Learning and Understanding
Personally, I did not use AI in this class. My coding skills are not the best, so I wanted to challenge myself to try to do my work without AI. I feel that by forcing myself to do the work without any assistance, I was able to develop a stronger foundation in understanding how to code, especially when it came to JavaScript. I think JavaScript was one of the most difficult parts of this class, but I feel that my struggling has allowed me to learn. I do think that AI can have a positive impact on understanding software engineering concepts. In some cases, working backwards from the solution can provide a lot of information on why the code works, and can use this knowledge to apply to the work in this class.

### Practical Applications
