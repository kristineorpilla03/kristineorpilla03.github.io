<h2 id="interest-in-software-engineering">Interest in Software Engineering</h2>

<p>Computer science is the career field that I aspire to be in after college. I am interested in either pursuing software engineering or data science. My interest in software engineering was due to my CTE courses in high school. For three years, I took computer science classes where I was introduced to multiple coding languages. My coding teacher had my classmates and I develop our own projects, where we were able to enter different competitions. Being exposed to this process of building and designing projects peaked my interest in software engineering. I would love to continue taking software engineering courses at the college level and to work on personal projects to improve upon and to gain more experience with software development.</p>

<h2 id="my-hope-for-the-future">My Hope for the Future</h2>

<p>To better prepare me for a future in software engineering, there are many skills that I would like to develop. I would like to be proficient in the languages that I have learned over the years. I want to do this by completing personal projects to enforce my knowledge in the languages and to showcase my abilities in that language. Another skill I would like to develop for the future is to explore different softwares to develop code. For example, I want to learn how to use Meteor and Bootstrap to produce projects.</p>

<p>In the future, I would love to get more experience in the computer science field. This school year, I am focusing on finding internship opportunities that I can apply to. This would allow me to get experience in applying for jobs, preparing and participating in technical interviews, and learning about the expectations for a software engineer. Another experience I would love to have in the future is being a part of projects that are focused on community improvement. I want to be able to give back to the community in any form, so working on software that can positively impact the community would be an amazing experience for me.</p>
