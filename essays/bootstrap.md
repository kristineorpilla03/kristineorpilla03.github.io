## The Importance of Asking Smart Questions

Sometimes, when code does not work the way it should, we spend hours looking at our computer screen, wondering where we went wrong. In most cases, it was just a spelling error or missing a symbol, like a semicolon or a closing brace. However, when we run into more difficult problems, figuring out how to fix our errors gets frustrating. With that, we can turn to our buddy: the internet.

The internet is a great place to search for why code is not working. Software engineers can post problems that they are facing in their code onto forums in hopes that someone will be able and willing to help them. It is very important for software engineers to ask smart questions to get good answers in return. By asking smart questions, people on the site can easily understand what specific problem the software engineer is facing and provide help. This saves people’s time from having to decipher the post and figure out what the error is. Knowing how to ask smart questions is a great skill that software engineers should have to effectively convey their errors to others.

## A Smart Question

An example of a smart question on Stack Overflow is one where someone asked why a sorted array is processed faster than an unsorted array. The person describes that they noticed this behavior in C++, so to ensure that this behavior is consistent, they tested it out in Java and got the same result. This is a great example of a smart question because the person clearly states the question they need help with. They also showcased that they exerted effort into finding an answer to their question by testing things out in different languages. By coding in Java to verify that the process times behaved similarly to the process times in C++, it shows to other people on the site that the person explored the possibility that the result was language-specific, but through testing, this possibility was ruled out. Due to the person asking a smart question, they were able to receive a numerous amount of answers that address their question.

## A Not So Smart Question

A not so smart question I found on Stack Overflow is where the person is asking for help to find the error in their code because the program is not updating with the given input from the user. The person included all of their code, with a short explanation of what their code does. This is an example of a not so smart question because they did not follow etiquette rules that makes people on the site want to help them. For example, improper grammar was used, where capitalization of the first word of the sentence or “I” were not followed. By following grammatical rules, it demonstrates that the person added effort into writing their question. The person also explicitly wrote that they did not do anything to troubleshoot their error. By stating this, it shows lack of effort from the person asking the question. It discourages people from wanting to help them if the person asking for help did not try. Lastly, their subject line was not informational enough. It was, “need help in html, css and js.” This subject line is not very informative of what problem the person is facing. Having details throughout the post can provide people with information to work with that can lead to helpful answers. The question did receive one comment, however it was downvoted to reach a score of -6. This is an indication that people were not willing to help them with their coding problems.

## Takeaways

Asking smart questions is a vital skill as a software engineer. Not only is it helpful when posting questions on forums, but also important when communicating with other software engineers. By doing research before posting, being specific in errors in the code and providing ways that were used to troubleshoot, are a great foundation towards smart questions. Seeing real-life examples of great and not so great questions provided me with a new perspective on approaching people with programming questions.
