# Understanding Design Patterns
A concept that I have been using throughout this class without realizing it is design pattern. In software engineering, a design pattern is a coding solution that is used and adjusted to fit the specific needs of a common problem. There are many different examples of design patterns, but I was able to learn in depth about four examples: factory, singleton, observer, and MVC. The design pattern I understood the most was singleton. In a singleton design pattern, it aims to solve the problem of having a global variable. This allows the global state to be accessed by everyone, which is a way around having global variables in languages where it is not implemented. In software engineering, design patterns are very helpful.

Although at first glance, using design patterns seems like a great thing to use with no downsides, I learned that there are still some negative aspects of them. I learned that there are antipatterns, which are solutions to a common problem but does not fully solve the problem. A great example that helped me better understand this concept is from the lecture video of lava flow. The example explained that a lava flow is when a design pattern is utilized in the code for a very long time, so as time goes on and code is growing, there may be instances where the design pattern code may not be understood on its purpose. It is a possibility that the section of code might not even work. However, because the code has been in the program for so long, people may see modifying the code as risky as it may ruin the whole program, so the dead code is left there. It was very interesting to not only learn about the plus sides of design patterns, but also their downfalls.

# Utilizing Design Patterns
Throughout this course, I was able to be exposed to different examples of design patterns without knowing what they were. The few design pattern types I want to further explain are observer and singleton.

One of the design pattern types that I was able to explore from class work and assignments were observers. The observer design pattern type is when the state of a subject is changed, there are objects that react. The design pattern that is an example of this type is called Reactive Data. In the code I was able to use and create, this pattern can be seen when dealing with data in the software. From my understanding, when data is added, changed, or removed, the code will be re-run to be updated to match the actions of what happened. For example, if adding a new object in a collection, the code will re-run due to the change to accommodate the added object.

Another design pattern type I was able to experience coding with is singleton. I used singleton when using collections. In my group’s final project, we utilized two collections: EventCollection and ProfileCollection. We used the same structure when creating both collections, but each with their own adjustments. By doing this, we were able to create an instance of each collection that we used throughout the project. An example of using the collection is when displaying the information of an event. We used dot notation to access the variable’s data that we want to display.

# Takeaways
All in all, design patterns are widely used throughout software engineering to efficiently tackle frequently occurring problems. Working with design patterns was a great opportunity for me to learn about the concept.
