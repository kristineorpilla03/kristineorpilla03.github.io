## Overview
_The problem_: The University of Hawai'i at Mānoa (UH Mānoa) is a very diverse school that holds many talented individuals. Despite this, there exists a problem related to social interactions. This issue is from the absence of a platform that serves connections between students who share common interests, talents, and goals.

_The solution_: Introducing "Manoa Mingle" – a dating and socialization platform designed exclusively for the university's community. This application lets students register and create profiles, featuring information such as their name, major, age, personal descriptions, interests, and preferences. Additionally, users can enhance their profiles by uploading an image and linking their social media profiles, should they wish to take their connections to the next level ;).

## Approach
Once a new user creates a profile, they are able to browse a page of other profiles filtered by major, interests, and age to find potential connections.

Users are able to “heart” a profile that interests them and those are collected in a separate page of matching profiles if those users also put a “heart” on their profile as well.

Administrators can monitor profiles and take down inappropriate content when necessary.

Some mockup pages include:
* Landing Page
* My Profile Page
* Profiles Page
* Matched Page

## Use Case Ideas
* New user goes to the landing page, signs up for an account, and creates a profile.
* Admin goes to the landing page, logs in, and edits the website.
* User goes to the landing page, logs in, and “heart” profiles to match with.
* User goes to the matched page to see profiles they are matched with.

## Beyond the Basics
* The user will receive a notification when logging in if they have matched with someone.
* Notifying the user when they are matched with a person via email.
