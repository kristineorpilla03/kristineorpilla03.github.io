Pics-a-Goal is a game created to compete in the Open Challenge in the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge. The game was created to teach people, specifically the younger generation in Hawaii, about the state's sustainability goals. The game works by providing the user with an image that relates to one of the sustainability goals. There are four options of goals on the bottom of the image where the user will then have to choose which of the goals provided matches the image above. At the end of the game, a summary of each of the sustainability goals will appear, to inform and educate the user.
