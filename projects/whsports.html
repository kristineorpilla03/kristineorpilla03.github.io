<p>WHSports is a workout app that my team and I created for our final project in our coding class. We then improved upon the app to compete in the Congressional App Challenge the following school year. Then, in my senior year, my partner and I further developed the app for our STEM and CTE capstone project. The video above is our submission for the Congressional App Challenge.</p>

<p>WHSports is a workout app for Waipahu High School student-athletes to practice for their specific sport. We aimed the app towards both beginners and advanced players, so students who are planning to try out for the sport and current players on the team can utilize the app. Although WHSports is catered specifically towards student-athletes, anyone may use the app to exercise.</p>

<p>The app works by showcasing different sports that are offered on the app. For our app, we were able to gather data from Girl’s Softball and Girl’s Soccer. When clicking on one of the sports, there are two options: warm-ups and workouts. When clicking on the warm-ups option, it will showcase an exercise accompanied by a visual representation of how to do it, and also the amount of reps. Next is the workouts portion. The app was meant to cater towards a 30-day usage, so ideally, as the days progress the workouts will increase in difficulty. So when choosing a day, it will showcase workouts that aim to improve upon necessary skills needed for the sport. It is accompanied by a timer and a visual representation of the workout.</p>

<p>As it is a sports app for Waipahu High School students, there is an information page for all of the sports offered at the high school and all the pertinent information about the sport, such as practice dates, times, and location.</p>

<p>My contributions towards this project was data collection from students to create the warm-ups and workouts for the sports that are included in the app. I also worked on the HTML and CSS of this project, where both me and my team members all contributed towards. This project has allowed me to experience the engineering design process of identifying a client and creatine a product to help solve a problem they are currently facing. Coding this project has allowed me to expand on my HTNL and CSS skills outside of the classroom.</p>
